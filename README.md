# Archimedes

This project is a place where I am experimenting with several different things:

- What's the least wrong way I can find to wire up core application services in a way that can be used wherever I need them to be.
- Learning the basics of Durandal
- Making data flow through the application with commands in a logical and consistent manner
- Is there a better object mapper than auto mapper?
- What if we don't use entity framework?
